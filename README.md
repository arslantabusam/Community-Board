# Community-Board

A Dynamic Website consisting of a Client-side application, which generates page content from a server-side database, employs client-side libraries for data validation and display, sends data to a server for validation and storage, and receiving response data. A counterpart set of server-side software is created allowing persistence of data received from a client in a server-side database. 

Created using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache the database server, MySQL, and PHP) the only difference being that in this project we have used Windows operation system instead of Linux. Developed using core technologies of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  

The online community noticeboard makes use of a MySQL database to store the information contained in each of the posts.

A user can: Sign up, Create posts, View posts, Sign in, Edit/Delete posts, Sign out, while only an admin can Manage posts and users. The role is based on the data contained log in information and kept in record using sessions and cookies on the we browser.
