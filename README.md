**A Dynamic Website** consisting of;
*a client-side application, which generates page content from a server-side database, employs client-side libraries for data validation and display, sends data to a server for validation and storage, and receives response data. 
*A counterpart set of server-side software is created allowing persistence of data received from a client in a server-side database. 

Created using the **LAMP stack** (Linux, Apache the database server, **MySQL**, and **PHP**) the only difference being that we have used Windows operation system instead of Linux in this project. Developed using core technologies of **PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML,** and **CSS**.
